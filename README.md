# Issues-with-the-Solana-Blockchain-part2
Key Problems 1. Network Downtime and Outages 2. Scalability Limitations 3. Centralization Concerns
4. Security Vulnerabilities
Hack Risks: Solana has faced various hacking incidents, such as wallet draining attacks and vulnerabilities in smart contracts, raising concerns about the network’s security.
Exploits: Weaknesses in smart contract code and network architecture have been exploited, leading to substantial losses in the DeFi ecosystem.
Ongoing Fixes: Security patches and protocol upgrades are being implemented to address these vulnerabilities.
5. High Transaction Fees Under Load
Fee Spikes: Although Solana is known for its low transaction fees, during periods of heavy traffic, transaction fees can spike significantly. This undermines its original selling point of providing low-cost transactions.
Overload Risk: High fees during congestion discourage small transactions and limit Solana’s use case for microtransactions.
6. Lack of Ecosystem Maturity
Fewer dApps: Compared to Ethereum, Solana's ecosystem is still smaller in terms of decentralized applications (dApps), DeFi protocols, and NFTs. While it has grown significantly, it still lacks the same level of maturity as Ethereum.
Developer Adoption: Attracting developers to build on Solana remains a challenge, with many preferring more established blockchains like Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain.
